## Who am I

- By day: Developer of distributed databases at IBM. Helping to bring a sudden, but inevitable AI apocalypse a bit closer every day.
- By night: Coding for fun and learning new languages (_Japanese is so cool_). Playing guitar horribly and piano even worse. Writing
sci-fi books in a quiet of my closet.
- Fun facts: I live in a forest. I have two cats, and, by the way, cats _are_ better than unicorns. Once I drove from West coast to East coast in three days.
